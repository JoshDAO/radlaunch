## What is a regular ICO aka crowd sale?

The seller sets a number of tokens to be sold and the price for them to be sold at, a seller can do multiple batches at different prices.
Another version involves listing the token straight to a decentralised exchange such as Uniswap with a certain amount of liquidity staked by the seller.
